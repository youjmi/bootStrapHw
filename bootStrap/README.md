Hello.

In my assignment for this week, I was advised to create 3 different html files, merged to one. 
One of the suggestions found on the assignement's ReadMe is to utilize Bootstrap formatting, but also minimize the usage of Media Query found on line 20. You will notice that my tags have detailed codings to also minimize the usage of css coding as well (i.e mt-5//text-center/col-sm-md-lg on HTMLs only etc) which you will see on my CSS file with only a handful of coding there without media query.

Here is my deployed Link:
